\description{
This function applies \code{rule} (which takes in parameter settings and outputs
a synthetic dataset) and \code{criterion} (which takes a synthetic dataset and outputs
the results from estimators) to all the rows of \code{paramMat} (which is a matrix
that contains different parameter settings for each row). The distinction between
\code{rule} and \code{criterion} is only made by the user, as the user can design
exactly the same simulation that uses one but not the other.
}
\details{
The input to \code{rule} must be a vector (a row from \code{paramMat}), while
the input to \code{criterion} must be first the output of \code{rule} and second
a vector (the same row from \code{paramMat}). Both these functions is allowed
to output lists.

The output to \code{simulation_generator} is a list, one element for each
row of \code{paramMat}. Each element of the list is typically a list or
a matrix. This depends on how the user set up what \code{criterion} returns.

The function has a \code{tryCatch} call, so if an error happens, the result for that
trial and row of \code{paramMat} will be an \code{NA}.

The remaining inputs for \code{simulation_generator} are cosmetic.

\code{as_list} is a boolean, where if \code{TRUE},
mandates that the \code{trials} results for each row of \code{paramMat}
is returned as a list. If \code{FALSE}, then the results are returned as a matrix.

\code{filepath} is a filepath to the temporary save location. If set to not \code{NA},
\code{simulation_generator} will save the results of every row of \code{paramMat} there
as it runs the simulations.
